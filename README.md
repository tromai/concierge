`concierge` is an opinionated utility for provisioning charm development and testing machines.

Its role is to ensure that a given machine has the relevant "craft" tools and providers installed,
then bootstrap a Juju controller onto each of the providers. Additionally, it can install selected
tools from the [snap store](https://snapcraft.io) or the Ubuntu archive.

`concierge` also provides the facility to "restore" a machine, performing the opposite to "prepare"
meaning that, for example, any snaps that would have been installed by `concierge`, would then be
removed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Take care with `concierge restore`. If the machine already had a given snap or configuration
> prior to running `concierge prepare`, this will not be taken into account during `restore`.
> Running `concierge restore` is the literal opposite of `concierge prepare`, so any packages,
> files or configuration that would normally be created during `prepare` will be removed.

## Installation

The easiest way to consume `concierge` is using the [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/concierge):

```shell
sudo snap install --classic concierge
```

Or, you can install `concierge` with the `go install` command:

```shell
go install github.com/canonical/concierge@latest
```

Or you can clone, build and run like so:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/canonical/concierge
cd concierge
go build
sudo ./concierge -h
```

## Usage

The output of `concierge --help` can be seen below.

  concierge [flags]
  concierge [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command

```

Some flags can be set by environment variable, and if specified by flag and environment variable,
the environment variable version will always take precedent. The equivalents are:

|            Flag            |              Env Var               |
| :------------------------: | :--------------------------------: |
|      `--disable-juju`      |      `CONCIERGE_DISABLE_JUJU`      |
|      `--juju-channel`      |      `CONCIERGE_JUJU_CHANNEL`      |
|      `--k8s-channel`       |      `CONCIERGE_K8S_CHANNEL`       |

|       `--extra-debs`       |       `CONCIERGE_EXTRA_DEBS`       |

### Command Examples

The best source of examples for how to invoke `concierge` can be found in the
[tests](./tests/) directory, but otherwise:

1. Run `concierge` using the `dev` preset, adding one additional snap, using CLI flags:

```bash
sudo concierge prepare -p dev --extra-snaps node/22/stable
```

2. Run `concierge` using the `dev` preset, overriding the Juju channel:

```bash
export CONCIERGE_JUJU_CHANNEL=3.6/beta
sudo concierge prepare -p dev
```

### Dry Run Mode

Both `prepare` and `restore` commands support a `--dry-run` flag that shows what
operations would be performed without actually making any changes to the system.

```bash
# Preview prepare operations
sudo concierge prepare -p dev --dry-run

# Preview restore operations
sudo concierge restore --dry-run
```

In dry-run mode:
- Commands are printed to stdout in a format that can be copied and pasted into a shell
- Log level defaults to error (use `--trace` or `--verbose` to see more details)
- No packages are installed or removed
- No files are created or modified
- No Juju controllers are bootstrapped or destroyed
- System state is read for accurate conditional logic (for example, checking if snaps
  are already installed). This means if your configuration references files that don't
  exist (e.g., Google Cloud credentials), dry-run will fail with the same error that
  would occur during actual execution

This is useful for verifying what `concierge` will do before running it, or for
understanding what a particular preset or configuration file includes.

## Configuration

### Presets

`concierge` comes with a number of presets that are likely to serve most charm development needs:

| Preset Name | Included                                                                  |
| :---------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  `crafts`   | `lxd`, `snapcraft`, `charmcraft`, `rockcraft`                             |
|    `dev`    | `juju`, `k8s`, `lxd`, `snapcraft`, `charmcraft`, `rockcraft`, `jhack`     |
|    `k8s`    | `juju`, `k8s`, `lxd`, `rockcraft`, `charmcraft`                           |
| `microk8s`  | `juju`, `microk8s`, `lxd`, `rockcraft`, `charmcraft`                      |
|  `machine`  | `juju`, `lxd`, `snapcraft`, `charmcraft`                                  |

Note that in the `microk8s`/`k8s` presets, while `lxd` is installed, it is not bootstrapped. It is
installed and initialised with enough config such that `charmcraft` can use it as a build backend.

Presets are defined as YAML files in the [`presets/`](./presets/) directory. If you want to create a
custom configuration, a good starting point is to copy the preset that most closely matches your
needs and modify it. For example:

```bash
cp $(go env GOPATH)/pkg/mod/github.com/canonical/concierge@latest/presets/dev.yaml concierge.yaml
# Edit concierge.yaml to suit your needs
sudo concierge prepare -c concierge.yaml
```

Or, if you installed `concierge` from the snap, you can view the preset files on GitHub in the
[`presets/`](./presets/) directory and use them as a reference.

### Config File

If the presets do not meet your needs, you can create your own config file to instruct `concierge`
how to provision your machine.

`concierge` takes configuration in the form of a YAML file named `concierge.yaml` in the current
working directory.

#### Providing Credentials Files

Juju has some "built-in" clouds for which it can obtain credentials automatically, such as LXD and MicroK8s. Other clouds require credentials for the bootstrap process.

Concierge handles this with the `credentials-file` option for supported providers.

Juju's credentials are specified in `~/.local/share/juju/credentials.yaml`, in the following format:

```yaml
credentials:
  <cloud-name>:
    <credential-name>:
      key: value
      key: value
```

For example, a pre-configured `credentials.yaml` might look like so where Google Cloud had already been configured:

```yaml
credentials:
  google:
    mycred:
      auth-type: oauth2
      client-email: juju-gce-1-sa@myname.iam.gserviceaccount.com
      client-id: "1234567891234"
      private-key: |
        -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
        deadbeef
        -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
      project-id: foobar
```

When providing the path to a `credentials-file` for `concierge`, it should contain _only_ the details for a specific credential, so the example above would require a file like so:

```yaml
auth-type: oauth2
client-email: juju-gce-1-sa@myname.iam.gserviceaccount.com
client-id: "1234567891234"
private-key: |
  -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
  deadbeef
  -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
project-id: foobar
```

If you already have a `credentials.yaml` pre-populated with credentials, you can use `yq` to build the file for you, for example:

```bash
cat ~/.local/share/juju/credentials.yaml | yq -r '.credentials.google.mycred' > google-creds.yaml
```

In the above example `google-creds.yaml` would be valid for the `credentials-file` option.
